Hi! My name is Mohamed and Iâ€™m currently pursuing my PhD student at the Hamlyn Centre for Robotic Surgery, Imperial College London, United Kingdom. My main research interest is medical robotics !

I received my M.Sc. in Systems and Control: Robotics and Mechatronics (Cum Laude) in September 2016 at the University of Twente, the Netherlands. My master thesis was focused on MR Safe robotics for MRI-Guided Breast biopsy.

I received my B.Sc. in Mechatronics engineering (Highest Honours) in July 2014 at the German University in Cairo (Egypt) in which I conducted my thesis at the Institute of Automatic Control (IRT) at RWTH Aachen University (Germany).
